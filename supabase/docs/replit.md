# Brill Prime Mobile Application

## Overview

Brill Prime is a multi-role mobile application built with React Native and Expo. It serves as a financial service platform supporting three distinct user types: Consumers, Merchants, and Drivers. The application features a complete onboarding flow, role-based authentication, and dedicated dashboards for each user type. Additionally, it includes an admin panel variant that can be deployed separately for web-based administration.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

### Mobile Framework
- **React Native with Expo**: Cross-platform mobile development framework enabling iOS, Android, and web deployment from a single codebase
- **Expo Router**: File-based routing system for navigation between screens
- **TypeScript Support**: Type-safe development environment

### Application Structure
- **Multi-variant Architecture**: Supports both main app and admin panel variants through environment-based configuration
- **File-based Routing**: Screen components organized in logical directories (`/auth`, `/onboarding`, `/dashboard`)
- **Role-based UI**: Dynamic interface adaptation based on user roles (consumer, merchant, driver)

### State Management
- **AsyncStorage**: Local data persistence for user preferences, authentication tokens, and onboarding status
- **React Hooks**: Component-level state management using useState and useEffect

### User Experience Flow
1. **Splash Screen**: Animated logo display with automatic navigation based on user status
2. **Onboarding**: Three-screen introduction sequence for new users
3. **Role Selection**: User type selection (Consumer, Merchant, Driver)
4. **Authentication**: Sign up/Sign in flows with validation
5. **Role-specific Dashboards**: Customized interfaces for each user type

### Authentication System
- **Token-based Authentication**: Mock authentication system with AsyncStorage token management
- **Password Reset Flow**: Complete forgot password, OTP verification, and password reset sequence
- **Role Persistence**: User role storage and retrieval for dashboard routing

### UI/UX Design Patterns
- **Gradient Backgrounds**: Linear gradients for visual appeal and role differentiation
- **Animated Transitions**: Smooth navigation between screens
- **Responsive Design**: Adaptive layouts for different screen sizes
- **Icon Integration**: Expo Vector Icons for consistent iconography

**Documentation**: See `docs/api-integration-summary.md` for complete API endpoint reference

### October 08, 2025 - Social Authentication Implementation
- Implemented full social authentication (Google, Apple, Facebook) using Firebase Auth
- Added `signInWithGoogle()`, `signInWithApple()`, and `signInWithFacebook()` methods to authService
- Updated sign-in and sign-up pages to use functional social auth buttons instead of "Coming Soon" placeholders
- Integrated social auth with backend API at `https://api.brillprime.com`
- Social auth automatically sends Firebase UID, email, provider info, and user role to backend `/api/auth/social-login` endpoint
- Maintained role-based authentication flow - users must select role before social login
- All social auth methods properly handle errors, validate roles, and store authentication tokens
- Type system updated to support both traditional and social authentication flows
- **API Endpoints Fixed**: Updated to match backend expectations (`/api/auth/signup` and `/api/auth/signin`)
- **Firebase Config**: Using brillprimefirebase project with valid credentials

### Firebase Configuration Requirements
**Important**: To enable social authentication, configure Firebase Console:
1. Add authorized domain in Firebase Console → Authentication → Settings → Authorized domains:
   - Replit domain: `8ccdf747-ee96-4994-a1c9-a4efe9a653ef-00-3isb1t4b1rif8.janeway.replit.dev`
   - Production domain (when deployed)
2. Enable social auth providers in Firebase Console → Authentication → Sign-in method:
   - Google Sign-In
   - Apple Sign-In (requires Apple Developer setup)
   - Facebook Sign-In (requires Facebook App credentials)
3. Configure OAuth consent screen and app credentials for each provider
