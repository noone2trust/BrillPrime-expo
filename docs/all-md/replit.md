# Brill Prime Mobile Application

## Overview

Brill Prime is a multi-role mobile application built with React Native and Expo. It serves as a financial service platform supporting three distinct user types: Consumers, Merchants, and Drivers. The application features a complete onboarding flow, role-based authentication, and dedicated dashboards for each user type. Additionally, it includes an admin panel variant that can be deployed separately for web-based administration.

## System Architecture

### Mobile Framework
- **React Native with Expo**: Cross-platform mobile development framework enabling iOS, Android, and web deployment from a single codebase
- **Expo Router**: File-based routing system for navigation between screens
- **TypeScript Support**: Type-safe development environment

### Application Structure
- **Multi-variant Architecture**: Supports both main app and admin panel variants through environment-based configuration
- **File-based Routing**: Screen components organized in logical directories (`/auth`, `/onboarding`, `/dashboard`)
- **Role-based UI**: Dynamic interface adaptation based on user roles (consumer, merchant, driver)

### State Management
- **AsyncStorage**: Local data persistence for user preferences, authentication tokens, and onboarding status
- **React Hooks**: Component-level state management using useState and useEffect

### User Experience Flow
1. **Splash Screen**: Animated logo display with automatic navigation based on user status
2. **Onboarding**: Three-screen introduction sequence for new users
3. **Role Selection**: User type selection (Consumer, Merchant, Driver)
4. **Authentication**: Sign up/Sign in flows with validation
5. **Role-specific Dashboards**: Customized interfaces for each user type

### Authentication System
- **Token-based Authentication**: Mock authentication system with AsyncStorage token management
- **Password Reset Flow**: Complete forgot password, OTP verification, and password reset sequence
- **Role Persistence**: User role storage and retrieval for dashboard routing

### UI/UX Design Patterns
- **Gradient Backgrounds**: Linear gradients for visual appeal and role differentiation
- **Animated Transitions**: Smooth navigation between screens
- **Responsive Design**: Adaptive layouts for different screen sizes
- **Icon Integration**: Expo Vector Icons for consistent iconography
